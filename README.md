Step 1: Open any of the Tweet Scrapers located in the Tweet Scrapers folder. Once you choose one, insert all of your personal Twitter tokens to be able to use the Tweepy Library. Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies/ and download 7 days of data for the cryptocurrency that matches your Tweet Scraper.ipynb. Run all the cells and verify that all necessary librarys are installed. Once you run all cells, you should recieve a modified csv file containing the important data that will be used in the models.

Step 2: Open the Crypto Models folder and select both the No_Sentiment and Sentiment model for the cryptocurrency you selected above. Verify the required libraries install correctly. Follow the instructions in the comments of the notebooks as to not miss important information. Once you run a model you will download the models' image which can be uploaded to 'Images' folder located in the HTML Files folder.

Step 3: Open up the home.html page to access the Home Page, then click on the cryptocurrency image you selected earlier and your recently ran model images will appear.
